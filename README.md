# NVIM dotfiles

Restart of my NVIM dotfiles from scratch, as I was not 100% happy with certain aspects, especially the LSP setup.

Done by following along with the excellent [Neovim as a PHP and JavaScript IDE](https://laracasts.com/series/neovim-as-a-php-ide) video series from Jess Archer.

I've ~~stolen~~ borrowed a lot of the ideas and code from that video and from:

Thank you Jess!
